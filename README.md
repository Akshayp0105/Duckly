## 🦆 Why “Duckly”?

A duck can **fly, swim, and walk** — making it an all-rounder.

Duckly follows the same idea:

* 📄 Share **documents**
* 🖼️ Share **images**
* 🎤 Share **voice notes**
* 💬 Share **text**

All in one place — no limitations.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User creates or joins a room
2. All users in the room get connected in real-time
3. Files/messages are uploaded and stored in Firestore
4. Files are encoded (e.g., Base64) before storing
5. Other users instantly receive and preview/download them
